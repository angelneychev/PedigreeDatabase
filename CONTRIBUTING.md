## 🧬 Core Features

### Dynamic Pedigree Matrix
The core feature uses a binary path algorithm for ancestor positioning. When working on pedigree-related features:
- Understand the recursive database loading approach
- Test with multiple generation levels (1-9)
- Ensure matrix structure remains consistent

### Data Import System
When adding new data sources:
- Create a new folder in `data_import/importers/[country]/`
- Follow the existing Estonian import structure
- Include proper validation and logging
- Document the data format in README

## 🧪 Testing

### Before submitting
- Test the pedigree matrix with different generation levels
- Verify data import functionality
- Check responsive design on different screen sizes
- Test database operations

### Manual testing
- Create test dogs with known pedigree relationships
- Verify parent-child relationships display correctly
- Test health test recording and display
